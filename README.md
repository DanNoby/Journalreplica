# iPhone Journal App Replica
A SwiftUI-based iOS app inspired by Apple's Journal app.

## About
This project is my first experience in iOS app development. My goal is to learn **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, and the Apple development ecosystem by recreating the core experience of the iPhone’s Journal app. The app is designed to be **simple**, **beautiful**, and **privacy-focused**, with Face ID support and a modern, card-based UI. It was done and tested entirely on Xcode

## Features
 Face ID Lock – Secure your journal with Face ID authentication  
 Modern UI – Clean, card-based design with a purple-to-black gradient background  
 Add, Edit, and Delete Entries – Easily manage your journal content  
 Sort and Search – Sort by date or bookmark; search by keywords  
 Bookmarks – Mark important entries for quick access  
 Custom Dates – Assign and edit dates to backdate entries  
 Responsive Design – Built with SwiftUI for smooth animations and a native iOS feel
